# holbertonschool-binary_trees

## Description
This project focuses on understanding and implementing different types of binary trees in C, 
including basic binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL trees, and Max Binary Heaps. 
It also introduces tree traversal methods, tree properties (height, depth, size), and 
time complexity analysis for tree operations.
