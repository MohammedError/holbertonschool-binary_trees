# C - Binary Trees

## Description
This project focuses on implementing and understanding **binary trees**, one of the fundamental data structures in computer science.  
You will build functions to create, traverse, analyze, and work with different types of binary trees including simple Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and Heaps.

The project is done in teams of 2: **Mohammed Aloufi** & **Layla Alshehri**.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General
- What is a **binary tree**
- The difference between a **binary tree** and a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- The time complexity advantage of binary trees vs linked lists
- Definitions: **depth**, **height**, **size** of a binary tree
- The different **tree traversal** methods (preorder, inorder, postorder, level-order)
- What is a **complete**, **full**, **perfect**, and **balanced** binary tree

- Compilation will be done on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** with:  
  ```bash
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
